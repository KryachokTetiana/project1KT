    <p>In the twenty years since the first edition of this encyclopedia in 1996, herbal medicine
        has gone through unprecedented change. Herbs, which have always been the principal form
        of medicine in developing countries, have again become popular in the developed world,
        as people strive to stay healthy in the face of chronic stress and pollution, and to treat illness
        with medicines that work in concert with the bodyâ€™s defenses.</p>
